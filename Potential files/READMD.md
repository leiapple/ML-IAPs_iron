# Potential files

The files needed for running large-scale MD simulations via LAMMPS are provided.
- GAP: Due to the limitation of storage space, only $l_{\rm max}=8$ and $n_{\rm max}=8$ is provided. 
- MTP: MTP model with expansion level from 8 to 24 are provided.
- NNP: Two versions are provided, i.e. Radial and angular expansion $R=10, A=8$ with 10 neuron per hidden layer, Radial and angular expansion $R=10, A=24$ with 10 neuron per hidden layer
- PACE-FS: Six body interaction with Basis function that ranges from 50 to 500.
- PACE-FS: Six body interaction with Basis function that ranges from 50 to 300.

Due to the limitation of storage space, only limited versions of ML-IAPs are provided in the repo.
