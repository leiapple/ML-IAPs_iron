This repo is associated with the publicaiton: 
The repo contains two parts:

1. Training scripts of multiple machine learning interatomic potentials, including
   -  moment tensor potential (MTP)
   -  gaussian approximation potential (GAP)
   -  neural network potential (NNP)
   -  atomic cluster expansion (PACE)
2. The corresponding potential files ready-to-use for LAMMPS.
