# Figures assiociated with Publication  

This repository contains the jupyter notebooks for reproducing the Figures in publication. 
1. Figure 2: convergence analysis of RMSE (energy and force) for all machine learning potentials (ML-IAPs).
2. Figure 3: Testing energy/force RMSE as a function of the number of DOFs for all ML-IAPs; Pareto front based on testing energy/force RMSE.
3. Figure 4: Quality factor versus testing energy/force RMSE; Quality factor versus computational speed.
